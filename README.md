## About

This project aims to identify DNN dependencies within PTMs. In other words, we
aim to identify and measure similarity between two PTMs without reviewing their
source code.

### Dataset Utilized

To conduct our research, we utilized the
*[PTMTorrent Dataset](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/PTMTorrent)*.
For more information about the dataset, as well as instructions on how to
download and access it, please see this
[link](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/PTMTorrent).

## Project Layout
